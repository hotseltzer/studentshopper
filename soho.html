                        Housing Works Thrift Store is a great location for anyone on a budget, but also provides patrons a way to give back to the people of New York affected by HIV/AIDS and homelessness through the Housing Works Program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Located on Crosby Street about a block south just off Houston, this thrift store not only allows you to buy unique and quality items for your person and your home, but it is also in close proximity to the Housing Works Bookstore Caf&eacute.  The bookstore caf&eacute is a unique space welcomes all who are looking for a place to meet and relax.  There is even a special event space available for rent.

                        In God We Trust (IGWT) is another of those uniquely 'Sohoian' shops that can provide you with a multitude of neighborhood specific looks from the effortlessly chic West Village to the unintentionally trendy Brooklynite.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Located at the corner of Lafayette and Price Streets, IGWT allows visitors to clothe themselves in their vision of choice at a reasonable price point leaving you with enough disposable income to model your wears on the real world catwalk.  Which, let's be honest, is the most important part.

                    <p>
                        Club Monaco is a vision of every sophisticated separate you could ever want or need, for a price.  While their garments hold to a more simplistic aesthetic, they are impeccably made and thoughtfully constructed.  Club Monaco truly fulfills the old adage that, "you get what you pay for."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Located on Broadway and Spring Street, Club Monaco is in the heart of the Soho shopping scene.  Visitors to New York make this particular area a must stop on their tourist adventures, but don't let this dissuade you.  Once inside, the store offers the sense of calm the brand commands along with a beautiful respite for the eye from the chaos that is the New York City street corner.
