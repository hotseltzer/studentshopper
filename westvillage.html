                    <p>Home Works is a thrift store selling second hand clothing. What sets it apart, 
                       is that this is a thrift store in the West Village so the clothes are well 
                       maintained and name brands. You will not find chic-er clothes at bargain prices. 
                       Stock changes daily so you can always peruse the store for one of a kind finds.

                    <p>The clothes at this London clothing company are not your typical NYU 
                    student wardrobe but when it comes time to apply for those unpaid internships, 
                    with an outfit from REISS, there is no way they will pass you up. You will most
                    certainly be the best dressed intern.
